## Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly impacted the health sector, highlighting the need for improved public health measures. This project investigates how degrading air quality—exacerbated by pollution and environmental factors—affects the spread of the virus. The correlation between respiratory issues, air quality, and COVID-19 positivity rates was studied, alongside various medical strategies and governmental responses to safeguard populations. This project details the factors contributing to the ongoing pandemic, offering analysis and insights into its effects on different countries.

## Acknowledgements
