# ANALYSING COVID-19 and ITS IMPACT 

This repository contains a comprehensive project analyzing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on public health, air quality, and socio-economic factors. The project was completed as part of my Python Programming module during my Master's program.

## Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly impacted the health sector, highlighting the need for improved public health measures. This project investigates how degrading air quality—exacerbated by pollution and environmental factors—affects the spread of the virus. The correlation between respiratory issues, air quality, and COVID-19 positivity rates was studied alongside various medical strategies and governmental responses to safeguard populations. This project details the factors contributing to the pandemic, offering analysis and insights into its effects on different countries.

## Acknowledgements
It gives us great pleasure to present the report on the master’s Python final project undertaken during the autumn trimester. I owe a particular debt of gratitude towards Dr. Aine Bryne, School of Mathematics and Statistics, University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland, for his constant support and guidance throughout our work. His sincerity, thoroughness and perseverance have been a continuous source of inspiration for us. Only through her cognizant effort have our endeavours seen the light of day.
I also do not want to miss the opportunity to acknowledge the contribution of all the school's professors and tutors for their kind assistance and cooperation during the development of our project.

## Objective
To analyze the factors contributing to the COVID-19 pandemic, including air pollution, testing strategies, and their impacts on public health and socio-economic conditions.

## Analysis
For testing, a standard method known as real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction has been used. Results of respiratory samples through nasal swabs can take from a couple of hours to two days. Moreover, blood tests can also be used with immediate results. As of 4th April 2020, antibody tests are more accurate, but results take a couple of weeks to showcase any presence of the infecting virus. 
 
Patients have even tested COVID positive without the presence of any affecting symptoms of the virus in their bodies. A faster and risk-free alternative has also been collecting saliva samples using a sterile container when coughing. Along with testing in labs, a chest CT scan is another alternative for highly infected patients, but not in chores.


### About Data
This section discusses the data sources used for the analysis, including COVID-19 case numbers, air quality indices, and socio-economic indicators.

### Air Pollution
